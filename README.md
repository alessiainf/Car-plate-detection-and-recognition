# Car-plate-detection-and-recognition
Project for the 2024/2025 Computer Vision course.
This repository implements a complete license plate detection and recognition pipeline using YOLOv5 and CRNN. The recognition step is inspired by the methodology described in the PDLPR paper, applied to the CCPD dataset. Since no official code was released, the PDLPR part is reimplemented based on the original paper.
